- Prediction: "Do you think [aspect] will change in the future?"
- Evaluation: "What are the advantages of [topic]?"

- "Do you think advertising influences what people buy?"
- "What kind of things give status to people in your country?"
- "Have things changed since your parents' time?"
- "Do you think celebrations are experienced differently by different generations?"
